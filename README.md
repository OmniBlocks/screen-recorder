# OmniBlocks Screen Recorder

Have you tried screen recording tools like FocuSee? FocuSee has amazing smooth animations, click effects, and more, which is what filled me with the vile repulsive hatred to create the OmniBlocks Screen recorder.

Focusee has:
- Ads and sale offers shoved right in your face
- Weird system permissions
- Requires an account just to export
- Filled to the brim with laggy bloat and AI features that quite literally nobody asked for
- Subscription and freemium models

After doing a bunch of research, there is **not a single** completely free alternative for Windows, let alone open source. This is what led me to create the OmniBlocks Screen Recorder.

This is a greenfield project, meaning nothing is functional yet. Here's the plan, though

## Tech Stack
The project will be built using Electron (I know, it's bulky and whatnot, but I only know React, sorry) and using the (Windows Desktop Duplication API)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/desktop-dup-api] for the highest quality and FPS, and then React for the UI.

## Features

The goal isn't to be a replacement for other editing software like Premiere Pro, or be a one-size-fits-all app for video editing like FocuSee which begs you on its knees to use the editing features and AI avatar while staining your video export with a disgusting watermark. The goal is to simply add the cool smooth clicking stuff that FocuSee has that the big tech companies all use to make engaging and cool aesthetic trailers or product demos.

### Monetization and Ads

The OmniBlocks Screen Recorder will need you to watch an AD per export or pay a $694206721-per-month subscription for all the features.

Ha, scared you there, didn't I? No, OmniBlocks strives to be the opposite of that. We aren't a soulless corporation begging you to feed us your wallet like a stray dog, and we don't shamelessly rip off your privacy limb-to-limb like some manipulative narcissistic wild animal. This will be licensed under the AGPLv3, ensuring it is always open source.
